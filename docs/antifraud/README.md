# Anti Fraud

## What Is Anti Money Laundering (AML)?

Anti money laundering (AML) refers to the web of laws, regulations, and procedures aimed at uncovering efforts to disguise illicit funds as legitimate income. Money laundering seeks to conceal crimes ranging from small-time tax evasion and drug trafficking to public corruption and the financing of groups designated as terrorist organizations.1

AML legislation was a response to the growth of the financial industry, the lifting of international capital controls and the growing ease of conducting complex chains of financial transactions.


## Know Your Customer (KYC)

For banks, compliance starts with verifying the identity of new clients, a process sometimes called Know Your Customer (KYC). In addition to establishing the customer's identity, banks are required to understand the nature of a client's activity and verify deposited funds are from a legitimate source.8


Money laundering can be divided into three steps

- Deposit of illicit funds into the financial system
- Transactions designed to conceal the illicit origin of the funds, known as "layering"
- Use of laundered funds to acquire real estate, financial instruments or commercial investments

The KYC process aims to stop such schemes at the first deposit window.
